## Binary Search — 3 W’s

### WHAT

Binary Search is an algorithm that repeatedly divides the search space into halves to efficiently locate an element or boundary condition.

**It operates on:**

- Indices, not values
- A monotonic search space (sorted data or monotonic predicate)

### WHEN

Use Binary Search when at least one of the following is true:

- The data is sorted
- Searching an element
- Finding first / last occurrence
- Lower bound / upper bound
- The answer space is monotonic
- If a condition is true for x, it remains true for all x ≥ some value
  - Typical phrasing:
    - “minimum X such that…”
    - “maximum X such that…”
    - “is it possible with X?”

**Examples:**

* Square root
* Minimum speed / capacity
* Allocate pages
* Koko eating bananas

### WHY

Binary Search works because monotonicity allows elimination of half the search space at every step.

This gives:

1. Time complexity: O(log n)
2. Deterministic and predictable behavior
3. Clean handling of boundary conditions (first / last / minimum / maximum)
4. In interviews, Binary Search is valued because it shows:
   - Logical reasoning 
   - Invariant maintenance 
   - Boundary awareness

**One-line Interview Summary (memorize this)**

_“Binary search is used on sorted data or monotonic answer spaces to efficiently narrow down the solution by eliminating half the search range at each step.”_

**Mental Check (quick)**

_"If the condition does not change monotonically, binary search cannot be applied — even if the array is large."_
