- Time spent: 2h
- What I built: 
  - Transaction POJO
  - A util class with utility method giving total amount by transaction type
  - one main class to execution
- Key concepts touched: 
  - java stream
  - collectors `groupingBy` and `summingDouble` aggregation
- What went wrong / got stuck: 
  - not able to right grouping function
  - stuck in immutable class concept 
- Next day plan: 
  - Immutability & defensive coding
- Questions for review: (max 3)
  - What is immutable class concept? and is there other such structural concepts in OOPS?
  - Walk me through streams terminal and intermediate functions.
